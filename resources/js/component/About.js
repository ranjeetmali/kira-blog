                    Mankind is still backward because humans do not communicate in one inherited common language

                    Historic movements are mass movements, the movement of one group in its own interests differentiated
                    from the interests of other communities

                    When the masses march and play sport in the centre of playing ﬁelds and open spaces, stadiums will
                    be vacant and become redundant

                    Similarly, this applies to other groups

                    Since society consists of private individuals and corporate bodies, the expression, for example, by
                    an individual of his or her insanity does not mean that the other members of society are insane

                    A common religion, as well as the requirements of economics or military conquests, may create a
                    state which embraces several nations

                    Corporate bodies too have the right to express their corporate identity

                    The Third Universal Theory, however, now provides us with a practical approach to direct democracy

                    Deliberate interventions against conception form an alternative to human life

                    The social bond, cohesiveness, unity, intimacy and love are stronger at the family level than at the
                    tribal level, stronger at the tribal level than that of the nation, and stronger at the level of the
                    nation than that of the world

                    In a socialist society, there is no possibility for private production to exceed the satisfaction of
                    one's needs because satisfaction of needs at the expense or by means of others is not permitted

                    Since the new socialist society is based on partnership and not on a wage system, natural socialist
                    rules do not apply to domestic servants because they render services rather than production

                    Nations whose nationalism is destroyed are subject to ruin

                    Classes, like parties, sects or tribes, are groups of people within society who share common
                    interests

                    Likewise, those who work in a collective establishment are also devoted to their work because they
                    are partners in it and they satisfy their material needs from the production

                    The ﬂourishing society is that in which the individual grows naturally within the family and the
                    family within society

                    Both should state their wishes and be able to justify their "yes" or "no" vote

                    Some, if not all, of those higher interests will fall prey to the struggle for power between
                    instruments of government, for the destruction of those interests supports the opposition in their
                    argument against the ruling party or parties

                    Societies in which the existence and unity of the family become threatened due to any circumstance,
                    are similar to ﬁelds whose plants experience uprooting, drought, ﬁre, weathering or death

                    This struggle may be peaceful or armed, as is evidenced among classes, sects, tribes, parties or
                    individuals

                    If those ancestors spoke different languages and their children, on the contrary, speak a single
                    language, the off-spring would not necessarily share common tastes in virtue of speaking a common
                    language

                    Such a sentiment leaves its physical effect on the cells as well as on the genes in the body

                    This has been the case throughout the ages

                    Deprivation of the means of fulfilment compromises freedom because, in attempting to satisfy basic
                    needs, one would be subject to the interference of outside forces in one's basic interests

                    This will take place when the masses become aware of the fact; that sport is a public activity which
                    must be practiced rather than watched

                    The national factor, the social bond, works automatically to impel a nation towards survival, in the
                    same way that the gravity of an object works to keep it as one mass surrounding its centre

                    It is dictatorial for any individual or group to claim the right of the supervision of the laws of
                    the society, which is, democratically, the responsibility of the society as a whole

                    Violence and revolution, even though they reﬂect the sentiments of society regarding deviation, do
                    not constitute an exercise in which the whole of society takes part

                    Such a difference emerges between the groups of one people, even if it is on a small scale

                    The proof thereof is the fact that producers are still wage-earners despite the change in this state
                    of ownership
